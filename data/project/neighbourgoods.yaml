  A community created site that plots all the local businesses that are innovating and surviving during lockdown due to Covid-19.

  A crazy time in everyones life, but one that everyone is just trying to get by with. This site was built with my friend [Alex Thurman](http://www.alex-thurman.com/) and it was put together during the hopelessness of the situation, wanting to contribute something from our skill set.

      Built with modern web technologies and platforms, allowed the project to go up quickly and efficiently. Using Gatsby with Netlify CMS also allowed quick turn around while not sacrificing ease of upkeep.

      A form attached to the site allowed people to submit their favourite businesses, while still allowing us to check the content and ultimately give us the final say on pushing the businesses.
