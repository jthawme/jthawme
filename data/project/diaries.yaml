  These diaries were made for my 26th birthday. I had an idea to take a bunch of friends that I met in London, back to sleepy old Shrewsbury for my birthday and I made these diaries as a bit of a usual _goof_ but their responses were really nice so I put them online.

  Thanks friends! This turned out to be some of the nicest work I've ever made.
